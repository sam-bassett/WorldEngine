I initially incorporated WSAD-style movement - they are used as forward, back, left and right, while left and right
on the arrow keys turn the camera.

I have implemented night mode, which can be activated by pressing 'n' on the keyboard. Rather than a torch, I
went for a floating orb (more like a fantasy game).

There is also the ability to change the time of day by pressing the open or close brace key ('[' or ']')

Trees have been implemented as rudimentary street lamps, they can be toggled on or off using the 'l' key. They come on
automatically at twilight and turn off at dawn.
