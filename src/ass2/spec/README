I initially incorporated WSAD-style movement - they are used as forward, back, left and right, while left and right
on the arrow keys turn the camera.

I have implemented night mode, which can be activated by pressing 'n' on the keyboard. Rather than a torch, I
went for a floating orb (more like a fantasy game).

There is also the ability to change the time of day by pressing the open or close brace key ('[' or ']')
